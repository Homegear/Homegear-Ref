# Style Guidelines / HTML Elements to Use

Note that a lot of the reference entries do not follow this guideline. Help would be appreciated to apply it to all files.

## General

* Component names: `b`
* Inline code: `em`

## Variables

* Names: `em`
* Types: `em`
* Homegear-specific types: `em` followed by `a` with a link to the type.

## RPC Methods:

* Names: `em` followed by `a` with a link to the method. The method's name has to be followed by braces: `()`. E. g. `<em><a href="#setValue">setValue()</a></em>`.
